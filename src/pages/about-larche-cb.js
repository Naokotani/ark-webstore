				<h1>About L'Arche Cape Breton</h1>
				<h2>L’Arche International</h2>
				<h3>Identity and Mission</h3>
				<p>This process begins when L’Arche International consults all global communities of L’Arche to approve the following statements. These statements include our Identity (who we are) and our Mission (what we do).</p>
				<h3>Identity Statement</h3>
				<p>We are people with and without intellectual disabilities, sharing life in communities belonging to an International Federation. Mutual relationships and trust in God are at the heart of our journey together. We celebrate the unique value of every person and recognize our need of one another.</p>
				<h3>Our mission is to&#8230;</h3>
				<p>Make known the gifts of people with intellectual disabilities, revealed through mutually transforming relationships. Foster an environment in community that responds to the changing needs of our members, while being faithful to the core values of our founding story. Engage in our diverse cultures, working together toward a more human society.</p>
				<h2>About L’Arche International</h2>
				<p>The first L’Arche community was founded in Trosly-Breuil, France in 1964. Four people came together to share their life in the spirit of the Gospel and the Beatitudes of Christ. Over the past 56 years L’Arche communities have developed in various cultural and religious traditions all over the world. These communities, called into being by God, are united by the same vision and the same spirit of welcome, sharing and simplicity.</p>
				<p>L’Arche internationally has grown to include over 150 communities in more than 30 countries around the world. L’Arche has evolved into an ecumenical organization, welcoming people of all religious traditions, as well as those without a formal tradition.</p>
				<p>Each community is unique, yet we all share a common vision of the basic dignity of each human person. We seek to create homes and provide meaningful work for community members in an attempt to promote a world where everyone, regardless of ability or disability, is recognized as being of equal value. </p>

				<h2 >L’Arche Canada</h2>
				<p>The first L’Arche community in Canada opened in 1969, in Richmond Hill, Ontario. Since then L’Arche in Canada has grown significantly and today, is organized into four regions.

				<h2>Servant Leadership Model</h2>
				<p>The Servant Leadership Model created by L’Arche Canada in 2014 represents a collective wisdom of how the Identity and Mission of L’Arche is lived out day‐to‐day. It is intended to inspire, to guide and to focus the efforts of the thousands of people who choose L’Arche and who want to fully live out the Identity and Mission in their various roles in and close to communities. It is intended to support the growth of these leaders and to help them to stay true to our identity and to live out the mission and spirit of L’Arche with wisdom and courage.</p>
				<p>L’Arche is an organization rich in values and traditions with a wide‐reaching mission. There is no one perfect leadership model for L’Arche. As L’Arche continues to evolve over time the leadership model will need to adapt as well. This version of the model is an attempt to capture the magnitude of what is lived in L’Arche in Canada today.</p>

				<h1>L’Arche Cape Breton</h1>
				<h1>Founding Story</h1>
				<p>L’Arche Cape Breton was founded on April 5, 1983, when Janet Moore joined Tom and Anne Gunn and their family at their home in beautiful Iron Mines, Cape Breton. There, beneath the mountains and at the head of the Bras D’Or Lakes, they founded the community they called “Corinthian House.”</p>
				<p>Tom and Anne spent a few years in India, in Asha Niketan Bangalore, Madras, and Calcutta. They got married and were blessed with their first child, Sarah. But Anne’s cousin, Susan, was seriously injured in a car accident in South Bar, and they felt they needed to return home to be closer to Susan. They had originally imagined becoming a part of L’Arche Antigonish, but this was not meant to be. Instead, a group of people from the local area approached them about beginning a L’Arche community in Iron Mines. At this time Tom, Anne, and their three children were living in small cabin in River Denys, where Tom made a living doing woodworking. They took the risk of saying “yes” to L’Arche again. They found a piece of property in Iron Mines that was perfect for them – near the lakes, off the highway, and close to the We’koqma’q First Nation. With no money to speak of, they made an offer on the land and it was accepted. With donations, especially from the Sisters of St. Martha and volunteer help, things came together and the building of Corinthian House began.</p>
				<p>The dream in those early years at L’Arche Cape Breton was to liberate people from institutional life. It was a vision of a life of simplicity and solidarity with the poor, close to the Mi’kmaq people and sustained by the work of our hands. Inspired by the Acts of the Apostles and the early Christians, community members owned goods in common and took only what they needed. This founding vision continues to inspire our community members and inform our values to this day.</p>
				<p>The early years of our community saw rapid growth – in a matter of months the size of the community doubled in both people and buildings! Clearly, there was a real need for the message and the services of L’Arche in Cape Breton. But we soon realized the need for clarity especially around our ecclesial identity and our expectations of membership. We worked hard to formulate many important documents, including our Charter and Mission Statement.</p>
				<h2>Our Founding Mission Statement</h2>
				<p>When our community was first founded the pillars of thought were inspired by the idea of a life of simplicity, sustained by the work of our hands, and nourished by the mystery of God’s presence in all religions, races, and creeds.</p>
				<p>Our past mission statement was: “L’Arche Cape Breton is an ecumenical, Christian community. At the heart of our community are people with developmental disabilities and those who wish to share life with them. At the heart of our unity must be the poorest, the weakest, and those who suffer; those for whom God’s preference is shown and with whom God identifies”. As our community grew so did our values which is why we shifted from this mission statement and now currently use the same mission and identity statements as L’Arche International. However, these founding words still ring true in many of our daily activities.</p>
				<h2>Our Community Today</h2>
				<p>Cape Breton Island is a very poor area of Canada – the unemployment rate is high, and we have all seen first-hand the effects of this on people’s psyche and self-esteem. Providing meaningful work for each individual is essential for our shared life in community. So from day one, we have offered a work program to our core members. In the early days, it was a woodworking shop and a small farm. Community members looked after chickens and cows, collected eggs, and helped to build new buildings in the community. Our work program has expanded to include other projects such as framed art, weaving, two used clothing stores, an activity program, a garden, a café and bakery and a work placement program with local businesses.</p>
				<p>Today, L’Arche Cape Breton is home to about 60 people on three properties in Inverness County. We have six houses, a Chapel, a house of welcome, a gathering place, a library, a hermitage, seven work programs, and many acres of beautiful land. Our international diversity is a great blessing, as is the local Scottish Gaelic culture and native heritage of our Mi’kmaq neighbours.</p>
